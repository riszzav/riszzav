# **Hey, I'm Rishav (aka riszzav)**  

### **Professional Stuff (Because Resumes Exist)**  
By day, I'm an **SDE Intern at Boeing**â€”yes, the place where they build flying metal tubes. I write code that (hopefully) doesnâ€™t make planes fall out of the sky.  

By night, I turn into a **UI/UX vigilante**, fighting bad design one pixel at a time.

## **Tech Arsenal**  

### **Frontend Wizardry**  
React, Next.js, Astro, and Viteâ€”because vanilla JS is like eating plain toast.  
Tailwind CSSâ€”because writing actual CSS is so 2010.  

### **Backend Shenanigans**  
Node.js & Expressâ€”where I make APIs that sometimes work on the first try.  
MongoDBâ€”because SQL is just too structured for my chaotic energy.  

### **Design Crimes**  
Figma, Adobe XDâ€”where I drag rectangles around until they look "modern."  
User Researchâ€”because nobody likes an app that only its developer understands.

## **Things Iâ€™ve Built (That Somehow Work)**  

### **Eventure**  
An event platform where you can create, manage, and attend events.  
Basically **Eventbrite, but without the existential dread of ticket fees.**  

### **Zortus**  
A smartboard with Unity 3D and AI.  
Imagine **Tony Starkâ€™s whiteboard, but running on a mid-tier laptop.**

## **Whatâ€™s Cooking Right Now?**  
- **Breaking MongoDB** (oops, I mean "optimizing queries").  
- **Making websites load faster than my motivation on a Monday.**  
- **Learning Three.js**â€”because 2D is for people who still use flip phones.  
- **Messing with AI**â€”so I can finally automate my own job.

### **Final Fun Fact**  
I once spent 3 hours debugging a missing semicolon. **The semicolon won.**  

**Thanks for reading! Now go build something cool.** ðŸš€ *(Okay fine, one emoji.)*
